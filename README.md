Password Age Visualizer
-------------------------

This is the password age visualizer code for Privacy Watchdog. This add-on takes the passwords stored in your Firefox password manager as displays them using a [Bullet chart](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/bullet.html) via [d3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3).

Unlike the [https://github.com/mozilla/watchdog-visualize-passwords](previous visualizer), this add-on helps you separate your passwords by *age*. Passwords are displayed as [visual hashes](http://connectioni.st/2011/12/visual-password-hashing-for-your.html) with bar charts, representing their age in days. Passwords older than 200 days are highlighted in red, as to call attention to their age. Black marker lines appear on the bar chart, representing each occasion the password was used to sign up on a new website.
